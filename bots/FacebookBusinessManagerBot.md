# Facebook Business Manager Bot
Our Facebook Bot knows how to interact with Facebook's Business Manager to load
ad statistics, sync custom audiences from a CRM, push generated leads to your CRM,
and more.

## Ad Reporting
Facebook provides a rich set of statistics concerning your ads, with limited
capability to report on them cross channel. With Frakture, you can pull the ads
into the warehouse and see how your Facebook Ads compare to your other channels.

## Custom Audience Syncing
When paired with a CRM bot, the our Facebook bot can create and sync custom
audiences daily given a set of criteria. It will keep track of which constituents
you've pushed into a given audience - this will save you time, and keep your
audiences up to date.

## Lead Generation
Facebook forms are a great way to generate new constituents within your CRM, but
they once they've signed up, they need to make their way into your system. Our
Facebook Bot can pull leads daily from Facebook and, when paired with another
CRM Bot, can make sure that new leads are pushed into your CRMs as quickly as
possible.
