# Segments

Segments are simply sets of people.  There's many different ways to use segments, so at Frakture we've clarified a few different types of segments.

## Remote Segments
Remote Segments are defined in external systems, like CRMs or ad targeting.  Good examples are Groups or Tags or Queries, depending on the platform you're using.  Remote segments can either be a static list of people -- e.g. a list of email addresses or members of a static group, or a dynamic definition -- e.g. "People who have taken action this year".  Remote segments are useful for targeting custom audiences, or applying acquisition codes, or a host of other uses.

## Cohorts
Cohorts are segments that have a specific *Cohort Date*, whose membership does not change after that date, and often a set of rules about the members of the cohort.  For example, "Donors as of 2015-01-01" would be an example of a cohort.  Cohorts are good for long term strategic analysis, and evaluating the performance of a program over time, particularly when there are many disparate variables involved.  

For example, you may want to determine whether receiving more emails increases donor rates.  You would create 2 cohorts -- "Will Receive Light Email After 2020-01-01" and "Will Receive Heavy Email After 2020-01-01".  After some time has passed, you could compare the average donation rate of the cohorts, to determine which set of actions led to more giving.

The rules to create a cohort can be anything -- either backward looking, or forward looking if a program is just starting -- but the key thing is that once a cohort has been built, the membership *will not change*.
