# Frakture's Level 2 Services

Frakture's Level 2 unfurls director-level views of your organization's performance by enriching your source code data with campaign-level analytics.

Starting from the *source code dictionary* Frakture compiles from your [Level One](level1/level1_intro) automations, bots and humans combine to mark up your coding ecosystem with with information about those source codes' campaigns, channels, content blocs, audience targets, and other key analytical dimensions.

If you've used rigorous source code syntax, that's great: we'll teach the bots to speak your own coding language and take all the work off your plate. If your digital team tends to code differently from your mail team, the bots are happily multilingual. And even if your coding has been entirely ad hoc, the source code dictionary is a snap with manual overrides, enabling human hands to speedily straighten out even the most unruly tangle of data.
