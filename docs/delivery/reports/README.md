# Reports

Frakture provides a number of native reports, a reporting template for Google Data Studio, and for Enterprise clients also supports connecting a custom 3rd party reporting tool (Google Data Studio, Tableau, PowerBI, etc).

See our [Reporting Matrix](delivery/reports/NativeMatrix "Native Matrix") for more details on what types of reports are available, depending on the systems and data quality you can expect.
