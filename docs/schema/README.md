# Frakture Schema

A Frakture Warehouse holds many types of objects that have been mapped from various source systems into a normalized schema.
The most common object types in a Frakture Warehouse are:

- **Messages**: Emails, Ads, Surveys... Any form of data that presents information to a person, and their statistics 
- **Transactions**: Donations, Gifts, Pledges... Any form of data that represents a monetary transfer
- **People**: Constituents, Volunteers, Donors... Any form of data that represents a single person

Each type has a specific set of *Standard* fields that will be found on the primary tables for that type.
The standard fields/tables can be found below:

## Messages

Frakture Warehouse messages for a given system can be found in the a view named `<table_prefix><channel>_summary`. For instance,
the Facebook Ads for a bot with table_prefix "fb_biz_1t5" would be "fb_biz_1t5_ads_summary".

The standard message definition fields are:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| remote_id | The unique identifier of the message within the source system |
| publish_date | The date when the message was published - this can be the send date of an email, the first day an ad is displayed, etc |
| label | A shortened title for the message - this can be the subject of an email, the title of an ad, etc |

In addition to these fields that are captured from the source system, there are several appended by Frakture:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| message_id | The unique identifier of the message within Frakture |
| channel | A short word describing the type of message - "email", "ad", "form", etc |
| primary_source_code | A Frakture Bots best guess at the source code associated with this message. Can be overriden |

Individual Message Statistics are also pulled into the Warehouse and supplied alongside these definition fields.

The standard message stat fields are described below, along with the standard definition for each*:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| impressions | How many times this message was seen by a target |
| clicks | How many times a link from that message was clicked |
| interactions | |
| revenue | The system reported amount of money generated by this Message |

* Systems have different ways of calculating, tracking, and presenting these values. To see how each maps to the source system, check the documentation for that system.

In addition to these fields, Frakture appends the following [Attribution](/enrichment/attribution/) fields:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| attributed_transactions | The number of monetary transactions that Frakture has attributed to this message |
| attributed_revenue | The sum total of monetary transactions that Frakture has attributed to this message |

Specific Message schema definitions can be found [here](/schema/messages).

## Transactions

Monetary transactions for a given system can be found in a table named `<table_prefix>transaction`.

The standard fields collected for monetary transactions are:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| remote_transaction_id | The unique identifier for this transaction in the source system |
| ts | The timestamp when this transaction was processed, as reported by the source system |
| amount | The amount of money reported by the source system |
| source_code* | An identifier from the source system that identifies how a transaction entered the system |

 * Systems have different ways of representing source code information, and occasionally this is spread across multiple fields.

## People

Person records within a given system can be found in `<table_prefix>person`. The standard person fields pulled into the Frakture warehouse are:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| remote_person_id | The unique identifier for this record in the source system |
| date_created | The date this record was created in the source system |
| remote_last_modified | The date this record was last modified in the source system. **Note:** Not all systems report the date that a record was last modified - in this case this field is left null |
| given_name | The given name as reported by the source system. Normally corresponds to *First* name |
| family_name | The family name as reported by the source system. Normally corresponds to *Last* name |
| email | The email address associated with this record in the source system. If the source system stores multiple email addresses, Frakture defaults to the *Primary* email address. A standard Frakture deployment only loads one email address per person record |
| phone | The phone number associated with this record in the source system. If the source system stores multiple phone numbers, Frakture defaults to the *Primary* phone number. A standard Frakture deployment only loads one phone number per person record |
| street_1 | The first line of the *Primary* street address associated with this record in the source system |
| street_2 | The second line of the *Primary* street address associated with this record in the source system |
| city | The city of the *Primary* street adddress associated with this record in the source system |
| region | The region (state, province, territory, etc) of the *Primary* street address associated with this record in the source system |
| country | The country of the *Primary* street address associated with this record in the source system |
| postal_code | The postal code (zip code) of the *Primary* street address associated with this record in the source system |
| source_code | The *source_code* used when this record was created in the source system. Used as an *origin_source_code* for purposes of attribution |

## Advocacy Actions

For systems that support it, advocacy actions can be loaded into the warehouse on a per-person per-action basis - each action that a person takes is stored as an individual record in the `<table_prefix>advocacy_action` table. 

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| remote_action_id | The unique identifier for this record in the source system. **Note:** many source systems (such as Engaging Networks and Convio Lumninate) do not provide a unique identifier for individual actions taken. In these cases Frakture does it's best to assign a unique identifier to each action |
| remote_person_id | The unique identifier for this person record in the source system |
| ts | The timestamp recorded by the source system of when the action took place |
| source_code | The *source code* associated with this action, based on the link used to take the action |
| campaign_name | The name of the campaign associated with this action |

## Per-Person Message Stats

For systems that support it, mailing actions (opens, clicks, etc) can be loaded into the warehouse on a per-person per-mailing basis - each message that a person receives is stored as an individual record in the `<table_prefix>per_person_message_stat` table

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| message_id | The Frakture assigned ID for this message. Links to the `<table_prefix>message` table using `message_id` |
| remote_person_id | The unique identifier for this person record in the source system |
| ts | The last time these stats were updated within the source system |
| recieved | Whether or not (1/0) this message was received by the person. Some systems _only_ report those who received a message |
| opened | Whether or not (1/0) the source system recorded this person opening the message |
| clicked | Whether or not (1/0) the source system recorded this person clicking a link within the message |
| action | Wether or not (1/0) the source system recorded this person taking an action inspired by this message |
| hard_bounce | For email messages - whether the source system records a hard_bounce for this person |
| soft_bounce | For email messages - whether the source system records a soft_bounce for this person |
| unsubscribe | Whether or not (1/0) the source system recorded this person unsubscribing as a result of this message |

**Note** General message stats can be found in `<table_prefix>_message_summary` tables. For general reporting on how a message performed, we recommend using those tables. The *per_person_message_stat* tables be used for deeper reporting - how a message performed acros a given segment.
