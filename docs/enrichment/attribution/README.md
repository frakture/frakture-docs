# Source Coding and Attribution

## Source Coding

## Attribution
Attribution is assigning credit to a message for a specific transaction.  In Frakture, *attribution* is exclusively assigning transactions to the message that sourced them.  Also often known as *last click attribution*.  It does not include partial crediting across multiple channels, or other modeling.
