# Frakture Standard Source code metadata

Each source code can have arbitrary amounts of information embedded in it.  Frakture provides standard names for common elements of a source code, so

### Account ID (account_prefix)
An identifier for a specific client.

### Channel (source_code_channel)

Specific channel pulled out of the source code.  When pulling message out of a platform, Frakture also maintains information on that level, but the source_code_channel is channel information pulled completely from the source code.

### Source Code Date (source_code_date)

YYYYMMDD format of the source code date.  Sometimes different than the core message "publish date", as it relies completely on the parsing of the source code and no other information.
