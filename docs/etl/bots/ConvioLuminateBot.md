# Convio Luminate Bot
Convio Luminate Bot is one of our oldest, and thus must fully featured Bots.
Data-wise, it can do almost everything you can do in Luminate, whether you're
trying to keep up to date on your Emails, running reports using Report Writer,
updating a Constituent or Donation, or keeping a Group up to date.

## Email Reporting
The Convio Luminate Bot knows how to get statistics for
each delivery of a Luminate Email.
Once setup, it will pull these stats daily for any recent emails, which can be viewed in
the [Email Dashboard](/dashboards/email), or reported using your own reporting software.

## Constituent Warehousing and Reporting
There is a lot of information stored in Luminate for each of your constituents -
Convio Luminate Bot knows how to extract that information and store it in your
[warehouse](/warehouse/hosted). Once you have that information in the warehouse,
you are free to report on it and push groups to other systems using a
[segment sync](/automations/SegmentSync).
