# Getting Started

The key thing Frakture bots need to start processing your system data is simply _access_ -- to any and all data sources that'll be bound for the warehouse.

<div style="float:right; width:250px; padding:4px; background-color:#E8E8E8"><div style="position:relative; width:240px; float:right;" align=center>When transmitting any form of sensitive access information to Frakture, such as login IDs, passwords, and API keys, please avoid using plaintext email. We recommend using a service such as <a href="http://onetimesecret.com">One Time Secret</a> or <a href="https://saltify.io">Saltify</a> to generate a secure, password-protected link and share that with your Frakture contact.</div></div>_Access_ entails different things in the hundreds of different systems that Frakture works with. In many cases, it'll mean simply setting us up with a login like any regular user on your staff. In other instances, you might need to secure API access, or issue an invitation to our "frakturebot" user. We'll work with you directly on access configuration during your setup period.

We'll also need to get to your [data warehouse](delivery/warehouse/ "Warehouse"). If you don't have a warehouse, no problem: Frakture will spin that up for you as part of your setup. But if you do already have a warehouse or just prefer to self-host, we'll also need to get [database access credentials](startup/warehouse_access) to your warehouse.

Your Frakture contact or account manager will work with you on these items, but you're always welcome to reach out to our whole team at _support (at) frakture.com_.
