# Getting Started

The key thing Frakture bots need to start processing your system data is simply _access_ -- to any and all data sources that'll be bound for the warehouse.

_Access_ entails different things in the hundreds of different systems that Frakture works with. In many cases, it'll mean simply setting us up with a login like any regular user on your staff. In other instances, you might need to secure API access, or issue an invitation to our "frakturebot" user. We'll work with you directly on system access setup during your setup period, but you can also review our [per-system access guide](startup/system_access).

We'll also need to get to your [data warehouse](delivery/warehouse/ "Warehouse"). If you don't have a warehouse, no problem: Frakture will spin that up for you as part of your setup. But if you do already have a warehouse or just prefer to self-host, we'll also need to get [database access credentials](startup/warehouse_access) to your warehouse.

Your Frakture contact or account manager will work with you on these items, but you're always welcome to reach out to our whole team at _support (at) frakture.com_.
