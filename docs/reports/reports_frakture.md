# Frakture Reports

The Frakture console provides a large and growing number of [reports](reports/reports_intro) that are ready to deploy with Frakture standard services. You'll be seeing cross-channel performance data in a whole new way right from the jump.

Access your Frakture reporting library through the "Reports" link atop your Frakture console.
