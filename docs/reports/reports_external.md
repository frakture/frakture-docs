# Connecting to External Reporting Platforms

To maximize your direct control of [reporting](reports/reports_frakture), Frakture's warehouse can also be connected to third party tools such as [Tableau](http://www.tableau.com), [Power BI](http://powerbi.microsoft.com), or your own [Google Data Studio](http://datastudio.google.com) account (as distinct from the [stock Data Studio reports](reports/reports_gds) available from Frakture).

Any cloud-based reporting service that's capable of connecting to a MySQL database will be able to plug into your Frakture warehouse. Contact Frakture's support for configuration details for your warehouse, which might also entail IP whitelisting and firewall configuration to activate the connection.

Once the connection is established, you'll have access in the reporting system to the tables generated in the Frakture warehouse and should be able to deploy the reporting software's dataviz and analytical tools.

Note that service contracts for outside reporting tools, which are wholly distinct from your Frakture contract, must be secured directly with their respective vendors. Frakture also cannot take responsibility for optimizing and troubleshooting report builds in these external systems.
