# Overview

Frakture's fleet of bots automates handling of your digital data, simultaneously freeing up your staff's time and expanding your analytical capacity so that your whole team can do a lot more with a lot less sweat.

The Frakture product deploys in escalating levels, all comprising mutually complementary features that operate out of a [data warehouse](delivery/warehouse/ "Warehouse") where all your various systems' outputs can be combined and coordinated. (We'll use your warehouse if you've got one already, or we'll deploy a warehouse for you if you don't.)

* **Level 1**
[Level 1](level1/level1_intro) gets you started with the benefits of data automation and standardization, with daily refreshes of your organization's lifeblood data. You can think of it as immediate tactical support: let bots take over the tedious spadework of refreshing data reports.

* **Level 2**
At Level 2 the bots go to work automating analysis on the data they load into the warehouse. You'll get deeper dive reporting into campaigns and content, like omnichannel source code-based attribution connecting your transactions (on all platforms) to your ads, emails, and other messaging (on all platforms)

* **Level 3**
Level 3 brings strategic reporting to guide executives with long-term decisions, like lifetime donor value.

Ready to level up your digital game? The best part of all is that it's surprisingly easy to [get started](startup/general).
