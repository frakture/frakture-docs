# Frakture's Level 1 Services

Frakture's Level 1 gets you started with the benefits of data automation and standardization, with daily refreshes of your organization's lifeblood data. You can think of it as immediate tactical support: let bots take over the tedious spadework of refreshing data reports. You and your staff have better things to do!

Specifically, Level 1 comprises three related features:

* **Scheduled loading of data** from source systems (including dozens of CRMs, message platforms, social media, and more) into your [warehouse](delivery/warehouse/ "Warehouse") where it's right at your fingertips. For each system, Frakture's bots will load any or all of
  * *People* (constituents, members, donors, or supporters on your list)
  * *Transactions* (financial gifts and payments)
  * *Messages* (Frakture's catch-all term for the emails, ads, and social media posts you send, each with all their platform-specific performance metrics)

* **Standardization of that data** into Frakture's modular, machinable data formats so that it's easily reported and compared across all your channels.

* **Source code-driven attribution** linking transactions to messages, across all channels and platforms, so the brass-tacks metrics your team needs are right at their fingertips without hours lost to finagling spreadsheets.
